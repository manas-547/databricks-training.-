# SQL Joins Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This assignment demonstrates the use of different SQL JOIN operations in PostgreSQL using a simple Student-Course Management database.

The database contains four tables:

- `students`
- `courses`
- `instructors`
- `enrollments`

The assignment focuses on:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN
- CROSS JOIN

It also includes handling unmatched records and generating reports using multiple table joins.

# 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this assignment are:

- Understand SQL JOIN concepts
- Retrieve related data from multiple tables
- Handle NULL and unmatched rows
- Generate reports using joins
- Practice PostgreSQL queries

---

# 📚 Topics Covered

## ✅ LEFT JOIN
Used to retrieve all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

Example tasks:
- Students with enrolled courses
- Courses without enrollments
- Students not enrolled in any course

---

## ✅ RIGHT JOIN
Used to retrieve all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

Example task:
- Students and enrollment information using RIGHT JOIN

---

## ✅ FULL OUTER JOIN
Used to retrieve all matching and non-matching rows from both tables.

Example tasks:
- Students and enrollments
- Instructors and courses

---

## ✅ CROSS JOIN
Used to generate all possible combinations of rows between two tables.

Example task:
- Every student with every course
